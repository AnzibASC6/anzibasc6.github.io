                    A watch is a timepiece intended to be carried or worn by a person. It is designed to keep working despite the motions caused
                    by the person's activities. A wristwatch is designed to be worn around the wrist, attached by a watch
                    strap or other type of bracelet. A pocket watch is designed for a person to carry in a pocket. Watches
                    progressed in the 17th century from spring-powered clocks, which appeared as early as the 14th century.
                    During most of its history the watch was a mechanical device, driven by clockwork, powered by winding
                    a mainspring, and keeping time with an oscillating balance wheel. In the 1960s the electronic quartz
                    watch was invented, which was powered by a battery and kept time with a vibrating quartz crystal. By
                    the 1980s the quartz watch had taken over most of the market from the mechanical watch. Today most watches
                    that are inexpensive and medium-priced, used mainly for timekeeping, have quartz movements. Expensive
                    collectible watches, valued more for their elaborate craftsmanship, aesthetic appeal and glamorous design
                    than for simple timekeeping, often have traditional mechanical movements, even though they are less accurate
                    and more expensive than electronic ones. Various extra features, called "complications", such as moon-phase
                    displays and the different types of tourbillon, are sometimes included. Modern watches often display
                    the day, date, month and year, and electronic watches may have many other functions. Time-related features
                    such as timers, chronographs and alarm functions are common. Some modern designs incorporate calculators,
                    GPS and Bluetooth technology or have heart-rate monitoring capabilities. Some watches use radio clock
                    technology to regularly correct the time.

                    A mechanical watch is a watch that uses a mechanism to measure the passage of time, as opposed to modern quartz watches which
                    function electronically. It is driven by a spring (called a mainspring) which must be wound periodically.
                    Its force is transmitted through a series of gears to power the balance wheel, a weighted wheel which
                    oscillates back and forth at a constant rate. A device called an escapement releases the watch's wheels
                    to move forward a small amount with each swing of the balance wheel, moving the watch's hands forward
                    at a constant rate. This makes the 'ticking' sound characteristic of all mechanical watches. Mechanical
                    watches evolved in Europe in the 17th century from spring powered clocks, which appeared in the 15th
                    century. Mechanical watches are typically not as accurate as modern electronic quartz watches, and they
                    require periodic cleaning by a skilled watchmaker. Since the 1970s, quartz watches have taken over most
                    of the watch market, and mechanical watches are now mostly a high-end product, purchased for aesthetic
                    reasons, for appreciation of their fine craftsmanship, or as a status symbol.
